# 🤖 RoboGPT Overview

**RoboGPT** is Orangewood Labs' cutting-edge cognitive programming framework that revolutionizes how users interact with industrial robots. Developed in Noida, India, RoboGPT enables natural language programming of robots across multiple use cases, eliminating the need for traditional programming expertise.

## 🎯 What is RoboGPT?

RoboGPT is an **AI-powered robotic control system** that acts as an intelligent intermediary between human operators and industrial robots. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced AI agents, RoboGPT transforms natural language commands into executable robot actions, making robotic automation accessible to everyone.

### Key Concept
> **"Program robots with just voice or text commands"**

Instead of writing complex code, users can simply tell the robot what to do in plain English, and RoboGPT handles the translation into precise robotic movements and actions.
